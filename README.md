The NFRDI Procurement website is developed using React.js for the frontend, while the backend database is managed using phpMyAdmin.

### Let's get started.

Let's install some things first:

        ## 1. Install Node.js and npm

        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, and npm is a package manager for Node.js.

        - Go to the Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
        - Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js for your operating system.
        - npm is included with Node.js, so once you install Node.js, npm will be installed automatically.

        ## 2. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

        VSCode is a lightweight and powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft.

        - You can download and install VSCode for free from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

        ## 3. Install Create React App (Optional)

        Create React App is a tool that helps you quickly set up a new React.js project with a pre-configured development environment.

        To install Create React App globally, run the following command:

        ```
        npm install -g create-react-app
        ```
